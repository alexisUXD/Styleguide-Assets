### Legacy 1000px Static Grid

During the transition to responsive Metro sites we will be required to support current site format as well as the future vision. This will require us to design an Additional layout catering for this. We have created a 1000px, 12 column grid for this application and an additional Sketch template.

1000px - 12 Column
Fixed Width
